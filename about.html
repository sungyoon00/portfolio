                    Hi, I'm SungYoon and I created this website using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase some of passions.
                    <br><br>
                    I love all things creative, from artistic pursuits like music, sound design, filmmaking, and photography, to the more technical disciplines of acoustics, programming, and digital signal processing (DSP).
                    <br><br>
                    I graduated with First Class Honours in BSc (Hons) Sound Engineering & Audio Technology from the University of Huddersfield, where I received the "Best Sound Engineering Student" award for the highest overall achievement in my cohort.
                    <br><br>
                    Previously, I worked at Dolby Laboratories as an Audio & Video Engineer where I supported post-production workflows for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision across feature films, series, and music. My responsibilities included DCP and print mastering, along with audio and video calibration, A/V routing using SDI and AVoIP protocols like Dante, and technical tasks across MacOS and Linux systems.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m driven by curiosity and spend much of my time expanding my knowledge and skills—whether through research, hands-on projects, or exploring new technologies. Outside of work, I continue engaging with my creative and technical interests: building personal music and photography projects, experimenting with audio and camera gear, or simply practicing instruments.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m currently growing my portfolio and open to new projects and opportunities where I can continue learning and contribute meaningfully.
